<h3>Where will I have coverage?</h3>

<p>TELUS Wi-Fi Service is available at various locations in certain major cities in Canada. TELUS Wi-Fi coverage areas, and the connectivity in these areas, will depend on the availability of wireless access points and network facilities. These are subject to change from time to time, without notice.</p>

<h3>Will TELUS Wi-Fi Service always work in TELUS Wi-Fi coverage areas?</h3>

<p>TELUS Wi-Fi Service uses radio waves, and service failures or interruptions can occur due to events beyond TELUS’ reasonable control. These may include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Atmospheric conditions (including solar activities);
<li>Physical obstacles interfering with the transmission of radio signals;
<li>Limitations on the capacity of the network to carry traffic from all nearby users;
<li>Technical limitations of the systems of other telecommunications companies or limitations of the interconnection of transmission facilities;
<li>Defects or failures in network equipment; or
<li>Emergency or public safety requirements.
</ul>

<p>As a result, TELUS does not guarantee the performance of the Service and it may be interrupted, refused or limited. TELUS may also temporarily suspend or restrict the Service to maintain, restore or repair the network and wireless network access points, and to ensure fair network access to all users, TELUS may manage its network resources. For a description of TELUS’ network management practices please see telusmobility.com/optimization.</p>

<h3>Are user sessions limited?</h3>

<h3>Is the TELUS Wi-Fi Service secure?</h3>

<h3>Can TELUS cancel my use of the TELUS Wi-Fi Service?</h3>

<h3>Can any of these Service Terms be void?</h3>

<p>It is possible for one or more of the Service Terms to be or become void, prohibited or unenforceable (for example as a result of a new interpretation of the law).

<h2>Your Device</h2>

<h3>Who is responsible if someone else uses my Device?</h3>

To the extent permitted by law, legal warranties and conditions (implied or statutory) do not apply to the Service.</p>
